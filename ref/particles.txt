Particle demo
~~~

1) Strip back Mikroreise to simpler framework:
    - Remove unused FX, code, data etc. - DONE
    - Tidy up code and refactor. - DONE

2) Add Luapod back to control particle & emitter vars.
    - Register var with Lua/Rocket track.
    - Rethink emitter context:
        - Vec3 position
        - Vec3 direction (or use Vec2 pitch/yaw?)
        - Colour
        - Size - use circle plot! <= MODE 9 not MODE 13 => ARGH!

    - Register the emitter and drive from Lua.

3) Rendering investigations.
    - Plot as preshifted 8x8 sprites => 320 tinted.
    - Don't need to tint at run-time, just pre-tint sprites.
    - Have a sprite (sheet) index instead of tint value etc.
    - Animation frames.

4) Improvements to particle & emitter system

    - Emitter iteration function?
        - Do we need to emit more than one particle per frame?
        - Called after each particle is spawned?
    
    - Particle update function?
        - Called for each particle tick to update size/colour etc.?
        - Should be fixed per emitter, otherwise too expensive.
        - Might infact have to be baked in.
        - Additional forces (wind etc.?)

    - 


MISSING framework features:
- Add arbitrary tick functions (with self-remove?) e.g. screen fades.
- Direct VIDC write fns for palette changes.
- Palette pending to sync palette changes on vsync.
- Fast debug print to screen.
