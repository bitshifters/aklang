Verse-chorus-verse. Aka Into the Archie-Verse.
~~~
Follow the usual template...
- Decrunch with sysinfo.
- <Group> introduces <demo> at <party>. => Pseudo character mode w/ masked logo?
- Show a 2D effect to get things going. => Plasma?
- Show a nice 3D effect to move things on. => Glenz and morph?
- Interstitial with greets. => Lissajous dots + masked text?
- Another 2D effect. => Rotate and scale but looks good?
- A final more impressive 3D effect. => Multiple lighting and morph?
- Fun credits. => Dot or line tunnel + masked text?
- Clean ending or long trawl of text in Amiga case.

=> Doesn't need a high concept theme.
=> Can just be fun, with a kicking soundtrack and nice gfx.
=> Focus on things that Sarah hasn't done already. ;)
=> Minimise number of new effects. Focus on quick wins.
=> Don't outstay your welcome: 3.5-5 mins.
=> No black screens / black backgrounds!
=> Excellent colour palette helps, along with good pacing.

Open questions:
~~~
- ARM2 or ARM250?
- Loading?
- Scripting solution? Rocket or otherwise?
- Musician => Rhino?
- Artist for artwork and palettes => Spiny? Titus?
- Resolution? 320x256 or go 16:9 so 320x180 => common for modern Amiga.
	=> Propose 320x180 for ARM2 demos. Assume 320x256 for ARM250 demos.

TODO:
~~~
- New repo based on arc-django-2 and perf-test code.
- Setup 320x180 screen mode - have this from Rose repo.
	- (what about equivalent to MODE 13?)
- Add temporary music to set the tone/tempo.
- Create temporary scenes & sequence:
	1. Group/demo/party.
	2. 2D effect 1
	3. 3D effect 1
	4. Greets
	5. 2D effect 2
	6. 3D effect 2
	7. Credits
	8. Ending
- Could even just have a key press to switch between the scenes at this point?
	- Integrate Rocket later => need to decide which version/finish integration.
	- Perhaps this depends if Rhino is onboard with doing the editing?
- Need placeholder gfx.
	- RISCOS font plot?
- Improve build using Tom's Python scripts and makefile-foo.
